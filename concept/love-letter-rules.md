# Love Letter - Game Rules

## Overview

Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for two to four players. Players attempt to deliver their letter to the Princess by having the highest-valued card at the end of the round, or by being the last player standing.

**Players:** 2-4
**Play Time:** 20 minutes
**Designer:** Seiji Kanai
**Publisher:** AEG (Alderac Entertainment Group)

## Components

- **16 Character Cards** (8 different types, values 1-8)
- **Tokens of Affection** (or scoring tokens)
- **Reference Cards** (optional, showing all card abilities)

## Card Types and Abilities

### 1. Guard (×5 cards) - Value 1

**Ability:** Name a character other than Guard. If another player has that card, they are eliminated from the round.

### 2. Priest (×2 cards) - Value 2

**Ability:** Look at another player's hand without revealing it to others.

### 3. Baron (×2 cards) - Value 3

**Ability:** Compare hands with another player. The player with the lower-valued card is eliminated from the round.

### 4. Handmaid (×2 cards) - Value 4

**Ability:** Until your next turn, you are protected from all other players' card effects.

### 5. Prince (×2 cards) - Value 5

**Ability:** Choose any player, including yourself, to discard their hand and draw a new card. If the Princess is discarded, that player is eliminated.

### 6. King (×1 card) - Value 6

**Ability:** Trade hands with another player of your choice.

### 7. Countess (×1 card) - Value 7

**Ability:** No special effect. However, if you ever have the Countess and either the King or Prince in your hand, you must discard the Countess.

### 8. Princess (×1 card) - Value 8

**Ability:** If you discard the Princess for any reason, you are immediately eliminated from the round.

## Setup

Shuffle all sixteen cards thoroughly to begin the game. The number of cards removed from play depends on your player count. For a two-player game, remove three cards face down without looking at them. For a three-player game, remove only one card face down. For a four-player game, use all cards with no removal.

Deal one card face down to each player. This becomes their starting hand. Place the remaining deck face down in the center of play where all players can reach it.

Choose a starting player using any method you prefer, such as youngest player first, or through a simple random selection. Place tokens of affection near the deck. The number needed to win depends on player count: seven tokens for two players, five tokens for three players, and four tokens for four players.

## How to Play

### Turn Sequence

On your turn, you will draw one card from the deck, giving you two cards in hand. You must then choose one of your two cards to play by placing it face-up in front of you and announcing its name and ability.

After playing your chosen card, resolve its ability according to the card's effect. You may choose yourself or another player as the target unless the card specifies otherwise. Players who are currently protected by the Handmaid cannot be chosen as targets.

The played card remains face-up in your discard pile for the rest of the round where all players can see it. Your turn then ends, and play passes clockwise to the next player.

### Special Rules

**Protection from Handmaid:** If a player is protected by a Handmaid and all other players are also protected or eliminated, you must choose yourself as the target of your card if it requires a target.

**Countess Rule:** If you have the Countess along with either the King or Prince, you must play the Countess. You cannot play the King or Prince while holding the Countess.

**Empty Deck:** If the deck is empty when you need to draw a card, the round immediately ends and moves to scoring.

## Winning a Round

A round ends in one of two ways. First, if only one player remains who has not been eliminated, that player wins the round immediately. Second, if the deck is empty when a player needs to draw, all remaining players reveal their hands. The player with the highest-valued card wins the round. In case of a tie for highest value, the player who discarded the highest total value of cards during the round wins.

The winner of the round receives one Token of Affection as a reward.

## Winning the Game

The first player to collect the required number of Tokens of Affection wins the game. Two-player games require seven tokens, three-player games require five tokens, and four-player games require four tokens.

## Strategy Tips

Card counting provides a significant advantage in Love Letter. Pay close attention to which cards have been played throughout the round. This information helps you deduce what cards remain in the deck and what cards other players might be holding.

The Handmaid offers powerful protection. Use it strategically when you have a high-value card you want to protect, or when many players have been eliminated and you want to ensure you survive to the end of the round.

When playing the Guard, eliminate the more common high-value cards first. Since there are five Guards in the deck but only one each of King, Countess, and Princess, guessing Priest, Baron, Prince, or Handmaid gives you better statistical odds.

The Baron carries risk since comparing cards might eliminate you. Only play the Baron when you are confident you have a higher card than your target based on the cards that have already been played.

Psychological tactics can be effective. Sometimes acting confident or hesitant can mislead opponents about the strength of your hand, though this works best with players who know you well.

## Foundation Universe Variant: The Mule

### The Tragic Premise

This variant transforms Love Letter into something darker and more psychologically complex. You are not trying to reach the Mule. You have already been touched by his power, your emotions fundamentally rewritten, though you do not consciously know it. You believe yourself to be acting independently, pursuing your own goals, engaged in political maneuvering or resistance efforts. But every action you take, every clever play, every successful round, is simply proof of how thoroughly the Mule has conquered your mind.

The game becomes a competition among the converted, each unknowingly demonstrating their devotion to a master they think they oppose. When you win a round, you do not earn favor. You reveal that your emotional conversion runs deeper than the others. The tokens you collect are not rewards you seek, but evidence of your unconscious loyalty. You think you are playing for yourself, but you serve only the Mule.

### Character Substitutions

The eight character types are replaced with roles and positions within the Mule's growing empire of emotional conquest. Each represents a different aspect of how thoroughly one can be converted without knowing it.

**Informant** replaces Guard (×5 cards, Value 1). The most common of the converted, these are ordinary citizens who now unconsciously report on others while believing they act from civic duty or personal judgment.

**Han Pritcher** and **Bail Channis** replace Priest (×2 cards, Value 2). The converted captain and the alleged Second Foundation agent use their positions to draw out secrets. Pritcher believes his loyalty is genuine choice; Channis plays a deeper game. Both can look at another player's hand, using their status to compel revelation.

**Ebling Mis** and **Magnifico Giganticus** replace Baron (×2 cards, Value 3). The brilliant psychologist compares notes with others, seeking patterns in the chaos. The tragic clown plays his Visi-Sonor, its hypnotic notes compelling others to reveal themselves through comparison. Both force a comparison of hands, with the lower value eliminated.

**Shielded Mind** replaces Handmaid (×2 cards, Value 4). Some conversions include protective layers that temporarily hide the depth of devotion from others. These individuals believe their independence is intact, never suspecting the shield itself was placed by the Mule.

**Bayta Darell** and **Toran Darell** replace Prince (×2 cards, Value 5). The searching pair, hunting desperately for the Mule's identity, force others to discard and draw anew, hoping to expose the mutant himself. Their search is relentless, compelling changes that might reveal the truth. Ironically, they too have been touched by the Mule's power, though Bayta's intuition provides some protection.

**The Viceroy** replaces King (×1 card, Value 6). The Mule's highest-ranking converted servant, second only to the Mule himself. The Viceroy can exchange positions with anyone, reshuffling the hierarchy of the converted.

**The First Speaker** replaces Countess (×1 card, Value 7). The leader of the Second Foundation cannot risk exposure—near Indbur, a converted mayor might unconsciously report the encounter to the Mule or near the Darells, as those actively hunting for the Mule might recognize the Second Foundation's involvement.

**The Mule** replaces Princess (×1 card, Value 8). The mutant himself, the master of emotional manipulation. If you are forced to reveal your direct connection to the Mule, your cover is completely blown and you are eliminated from the round.

### Thematic Card Descriptions

**Informant** (Value 1): "I have reason to believe someone here is not who they claim to be..." When you play this card, name a character type other than Informant. If another player holds that card, they are eliminated from the round. You believe you are exposing enemies, but you are simply identifying those whose conversion is less complete than your own.

**Han Pritcher** or **Bail Channis** (Value 2): "Your position grants you no secrets from me..." When you play this card, secretly look at another player's hand. Pritcher uses his military rank to compel revelation, believing his loyalty is freely chosen. Channis manipulates through charm and guile, playing a game within a game. Both serve the Mule without fully realizing it.

**Ebling Mis** or **Magnifico Giganticus** (Value 3): "Let us compare what we know..." When you play this card, compare hands with another player. The player with the lower-valued card is eliminated. Mis seeks patterns through scholarly comparison, his brilliant mind racing toward a truth that will kill him. Magnifico plays the Visi-Sonor, its hypnotic notes compelling the comparison. Both believe they act independently, but both serve the Mule's design.

**Shielded Mind** (Value 4): "I know how to protect my thoughts from scrutiny..." When you play this card, until your next turn you are protected from all other players' card effects. You think you are maintaining independence, never realizing the shield itself was placed by the Mule to protect his investment in you.

**Bayta Darell** or **Toran Darell** (Value 5): "You must reveal yourself - we're searching for the Mule!" When you play this card, choose any player including yourself to discard their hand and draw a new card. If the Mule is discarded, that player is eliminated. The Darells hunt desperately for the mutant's identity, forcing changes that might expose him. Their search feels like resistance, but even they have been touched by the Mule's power, though Bayta's intuition provides some immunity.

**Mayor Indbur** (Value 6): "As Mayor of Terminus, I command an exchange..." When you play this card, trade hands with another player of your choice. Indbur, certain of his independence and authority, never suspects his conversion. He believes his every decision stems from rational self-interest, making him the perfect unconscious servant—important enough to influence others, yet blind to the Mule's touch upon his own mind.

**The First Speaker** (Value 7): "My presence must remain hidden from all eyes..." This card has no special ability, but secrecy is paramount. If you ever hold The First Speaker alongside Mayor Indbur or either Darell, you must discard The First Speaker. The leader of the Second Foundation cannot risk exposure—near Indbur, a converted mayor might unconsciously report the encounter to the Mule; near the Darells, those actively hunting for the Mule might recognize the Second Foundation's involvement. In either case, the First Speaker must withdraw into the shadows where the Second Foundation operates best.

**The Mule** (Value 8): "I am the master of minds, the conqueror of wills..." If you discard the Mule for any reason, you are immediately eliminated from the round. Your direct connection to the source of all conversion has been exposed, and your cover among the unwittingly converted is blown completely.

### Victory Condition

Tokens of Affection become **Devotion Tokens** or **Marks of Loyalty**. You believe you are earning recognition, proving yourself, or succeeding at your own objectives. But each token is simply evidence that your emotional conversion is more complete than the others. You think you are winning, but you are simply demonstrating how thoroughly you have been conquered.

The first player to collect the required number of tokens has proven themselves the most thoroughly converted, the most perfect servant of a master they do not consciously recognize. It is a hollow victory, but it feels genuine because the Mule has made it feel that way.

### The Emotional Weight

What makes this variant powerful is the gap between what the players experience and what the theme tells us is really happening. As you play, you will feel clever when you deduce what others hold. You will feel satisfied when you win a round. You will feel competitive as you collect tokens. These feelings are real, just as they are in the original Love Letter.

But the thematic frame reminds us that all this cleverness and satisfaction and competition could be an illusion. The Mule's power is not crude control, but the fundamental rewriting of emotional landscape. His victims do not feel enslaved because he makes service feel like love, obedience feel like choice, devotion feel like personal conviction.

This variant takes the lighthearted competition of Love Letter and adds a layer of tragic irony. You are not fighting for your own interests. You never were. But you will never know the difference, because the Mule's greatest triumph is that his touch feels like freedom.

### Design Notes

This variant maintains all the mechanical rules of Love Letter exactly as written. The cards have the same abilities, the same values, the same interactions. What changes is only the narrative frame around those mechanics. This is intentional because the theme is about how the same actions, the same thoughts, the same feelings can mean something entirely different depending on whose will truly drives them.

The variant stands alongside "Whispers from the Radiant: A Crisis in the Plan" as a second Foundation-themed game, but where that game explores the Second Foundation's careful manipulation of probability, this game explores the darker side of Asimov's universe, where individual will can be conquered so completely that the victim never even knows they have lost themselves.
