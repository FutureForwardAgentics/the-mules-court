Salvor Hardin quotes
"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent."
"It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety."
"A fire-eater must eat fire even if he has to kindle it himself."
"An atom-blaster is a good weapon, but it can point both ways."
"To succeed, planning alone is insufficient. One must improvise as well."
"Only a lie that wasn't ashamed of itself could possibly succeed."
"Nothing has to be true, but everything has to sound true."
"Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right!"
