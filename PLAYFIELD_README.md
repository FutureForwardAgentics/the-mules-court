# The Mule's Court - BabylonJS Playfield

## Overview

Complete game playfield implementation using BabylonJS GPU-accelerated rendering with Foundation universe theming. Features responsive layouts for 2-4 players, smooth animations, and immersive sci-fi atmosphere.

## What Was Created

### 1. **Foundation-Themed Graphics**

Generated three custom assets using Comfy MCP:

- **`img/playfield_background_space.png`** - Epic space nebula background with purple/red cosmic clouds
- **`img/ui_panel_metal.png`** - Metallic sci-fi UI panel texture with purple energy highlights
- **`img/devotion_token.png`** - Mystical all-seeing eye badge for devotion tokens

All graphics follow the Foundation aesthetic: galactic empire, dark space, psychic power themes.

### 2. **PlayfieldManager** (`src/babylon/components/PlayfieldManager.ts`)

Central system managing the entire game playfield layout:

**Features:**
- Dynamic player area positioning (2-4 player layouts)
- Deck display with card count
- Center info panel (phase, current player)
- Player status tracking (protected, eliminated)
- Devotion token visualization

**Layout Strategies:**
- **2 Players**: Horizontal split (bottom vs top)
- **3 Players**: Triangular (bottom center, top left/right)
- **4 Players**: Quadrant (one per corner)

**Animations:**
- Pulse effects for current player highlight
- Deck depletion warning (changes color when low)
- Phase transition animations
- Devotion token fade-in
- Protection status pulsing glow

### 3. **PlayerAreaUI** (Internal class in PlayfieldManager)

Individual player area components:

**Elements:**
- Player name with "YOU" label for local player
- Status panel (protection 🛡️ / elimination 💀)
- Devotion token display (animated eye icons)
- Hand indicator
- Border highlight for current player

**Visual States:**
- **Active Player**: Red border, pulsing animation
- **Protected**: Cyan glow with fast pulse
- **Eliminated**: 50% opacity, grayscale effect
- **Has Cards**: Purple glow on hand area

### 4. **PlayfieldDemo Component** (`src/components/PlayfieldDemo.tsx`)

Interactive demo with full game integration:

**Features:**
- Player count selection (2-4 players)
- Game state integration via `useGameState` hook
- Control panel with context-aware buttons
- Phase-specific actions (draw, play, end turn)
- AI turn indicators
- Game over detection with restart option

**UI Elements:**

```

## Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Foundation Theming**

Visual elements inspired by Asimov's Foundation universe:

- **Space Background**: Deep space nebula reminiscent of galactic empire
- **Color Palette**: Purple (psychohistory/Foundation), Red (The Mule), Dark metallics
- **Typography**: Clean, futuristic fonts
- **Icons**: Eye symbol (The Mule's psychic power), mystical badges

### 2. **Responsive Layouts**

Automatic adaptation based on player count:

**2-Player Layout:**
```
       Player 2 (Top)
    ┌──────────────────┐
    │                  │
    │   Center Deck    │
    │                  │
    └──────────────────┘
       Player 1 (Bottom)
```

**3-Player Layout:**
```
  Player 2    Player 3
      ╲        ╱
       Center Deck
          │
      Player 1
```

**4-Player Layout:**
```
       Player 3
          │
  Player 2 ─ Center ─ Player 4
          │
       Player 1
```

### 3. **Animations & Polish**

**Pulse Animations:**
- Current player area (subtle, 1.5s cycle)
- Phase indicator (on round-end/game-end)
- Deck warning (when ≤3 cards)
- Protection status (fast 0.8s cycle)
- Victory text (on game over)

**Fade Animations:**
- Devotion tokens (staggered 100ms delays)
- Status changes (500ms smooth fade)

**Color Coding:**
- Setup Phase: Gray
- Draw Phase: Blue (→ Draw Card)
- Play Phase: Purple (→ Play Card)
- Round End: Green (✦ Round Complete)
- Game Over: Gold (★ GAME OVER ★)

**State Indicators:**
- Deck full: Purple border, white text
- Deck low (≤3): Orange border, yellow text, pulse
- Deck empty: Dark red border, red text, strong pulse
- Current player: Red border, 3px thickness
- Inactive player: Gray border, 2px thickness

### 4. **Game Integration**

Fully integrated with existing game logic:

**State Sync:**
- Reads from `GameState` interface
- Updates all UI elements on state change
- Respects game phases (setup/draw/play/round-end/game-end)
- Shows current player accurately

**Controls:**
- Draw Card (when player's draw phase)
- Play Card (shows both cards when player has 2)
- End Turn (after playing card)
- Start New Round (on round completion)
- New Game (on game over)

**AI Handling:**
- Detects AI turns (non-player-0)
- Shows "AI thinking" indicator
- Disables controls during AI turns

## Technical Implementation

### BabylonJS GUI System

Uses `AdvancedDynamicTexture` in fullscreen mode:

```typescript
const advancedTexture = AdvancedDynamicTexture.CreateFullscreenUI('PlayfieldUI', true, scene);
```

**Benefits:**
- GPU-accelerated rendering
- Consistent z-ordering
- Built-in layout system
- Event handling via observables

### Animation Strategy

All animations use `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps smoothness:

```typescript
private animatePulse(control, minScale, maxScale, duration) {
  const animate = () => {
    const progress = (Date.now() % duration) / duration;
    const scale = minScale + (maxScale - minScale) * sineWave(progress);
    control.scaleX = scale;
    control.scaleY = scale;
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  };
  animate();
}
```

**Performance:**
- Sine wave calculations (cheap on GPU)
- No DOM reflows
- Continuous loops for persistent effects
- Cleanup on component unmount

### State Management

React manages game logic, BabylonJS handles rendering:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (playfieldManager && gameState) {
    playfieldManager.updatePlayfield(gameState);
  }
}, [playfieldManager, gameState]);
```

**Data Flow:**
1. User action (button click)
2. React callback (drawCard, playCard, etc.)
3. `useGameState` hook updates state
4. React triggers useEffect
5. PlayfieldManager updates GUI
6. BabylonJS renders to canvas

## UX Highlights

### Visual Feedback

**Immediate Responses:**
- Button hover: Scale 1.05 (50ms transition)
- Card selection: Highlight appears instantly
- Phase change: Color shifts immediately
- Player turn: Border color changes at once

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Start screen → Player selection → Playfield
- Controls adapt to game phase
- Only show relevant actions
- Debug info always visible but subtle

### Accessibility Considerations

**Current:**
- High contrast borders (red/purple on black)
- Large touch targets (buttons 40-60px)
- Clear text hierarchy
- Status icons supplement text

**Future Improvements:**
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Colorblind modes
- Motion reduction option

## Known Limitations

### Current State

1. **No Card Visuals**: Players see hand indicators, not actual card images
   - **Fix**: Integrate `BabylonCard` class for each player's hand

2. **No Discard Pile**: Played cards not shown on playfield
   - **Fix**: Add discard area with card stack visualization

3. **Static Background**: Image-based, not dynamic
   - **Enhancement**: Particle system for ambient stars

4. **No Sound**: Visual-only experience
   - **Enhancement**: Add audio hooks (already have TODOs in React components)

5. **AI Instant Moves**: No artificial thinking delay
   - **Enhancement**: Add 1-2 second delay with animation

### Future Enhancements

**Phase 1: Complete Card Integration**
- Display all cards using BabylonCard class
- Add flip animations for drawing/playing
- Show discard piles with card history
- Implement card dragging for play action

**Phase 2: Advanced Animations**
- Card dealing sequence (deck → players)
- Card play animation (hand → discard)
- Elimination effects (particles, fade-out)
- Victory celebration (confetti, camera shake)

**Phase 3: Polish & Effects**
- Ambient particle system (floating stars)
- Dynamic lighting (spotlight on current player)
- Sound integration (whoosh, chimes, victory fanfare)
- Tutorial overlay (first-time players)

**Phase 4: Multiplayer**
- Network sync for online play
- Spectator mode
- Replay system
- Match history

- Eventually replace React `GameBoard` component

### Why Client-Side Graphics Generation?

**Using Comfy MCP for graphics:**
- ✅ Fast iteration (generate on demand)
- ✅ Customizable (adjust prompts easily)
- ✅ Foundation-themed (AI understands aesthetic)
- ✅ No designer dependency
- ⚠️ Consistency can vary

## Integration Path

### Current State
- PlayfieldDemo works standalone
- Original React GameBoard still default
- Two parallel implementations

### Migration Plan

**Step 1:** Complete card rendering in playfield
**Step 2:** Add discard pile visualization
**Step 3:** Implement card interaction (drag/click)
**Step 4:** A/B test both versions
**Step 5:** Replace GameBoard with BabylonJS version
**Step 6:** Remove old React card components
