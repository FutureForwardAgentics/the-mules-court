### Layout Strategy

**2 Players:**
```
┌──────────────────┐
│    Player 2      │ Top
├──────────────────┤
│   Deck (Center)  │
├──────────────────┤
│    Player 1      │ Bottom (YOU)
└──────────────────┘
```

**3 Players:**
```
   Player 2    Player 3
       ╲         ╱
    Deck (Center)
           │
       Player 1 (YOU)
```

**4 Players:**
```
       Player 3
          │
  Player 2 ─ Deck ─ Player 4
          │
      Player 1 (YOU)
```
